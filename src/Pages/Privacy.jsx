          <h2>Welcome to Wixware</h2>
          <p>Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Wixware with the collaboration of <a href='https://appzaib.com?ref_by=wixware&page=privacy&lyv=true' target='_ublank'>Appzaib</a>.</p>
          <p>By using our Services, you’re trusting us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it.</p>
          <p>We use your personal information only for providing and improving our services.</p>

          <h2>Information from Website Browsers</h2>
          <p>If you're just browsing our website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. We collect this information from everybody, whether they have an account with us or not.</p>
          <p>The information we collect from visitors to our website includes the visitor's browser type, internet protocol (IP) address, referring site, language preference and the date and time of each visitor request</p>
          <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>

          <h2>Information fro users with accounts</h2>
          <p>If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account registration. You will create your own username and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "User Personal Information." The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as well as the amount of information you choose to share.</p>
          <p>"User Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a username and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

          <h2>Information Wixware does not collect</h2>
          <p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although we do not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>
          <p>If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on the website or any of our services. Wixware does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our website or content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 13, we will close the child’s account.</p>
          <p>Please see our <a href='/terms' target='_ublank'>Terms of Service</a> for information about account termination.</p>

          <h2>Basis of processing your information</h2>
          <p>Performance of a contract. The use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us. For example, if you use our websites to purchase our product subscriptions or services, contribute to a project on our Production Lab, create a profile, post and comment through our websites, blogs, or request information through our websites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that contract or request.</p>
          <p>Legitimate interests. We use your information for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our websites and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.</p>
          <p>Consent. We may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about Wixware products. You may withdraw your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email or by contacting us at the addresses given at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
          
          <h2>Public Information on Wixware</h2>
          <p>If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or pulling data via our API. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing Wixware information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape Wixware and compile data as well.</p>

          <h2>International transfer of information</h2>
          <p>The website is hosted in the United States and information we collect will be stored and processed on our servers in the United States. Our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that process information for us as described above may be located in the United States or in other countries outside of your home country; by using our services, you consent to the international transfer of your information by Wixware.</p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the websites, and their website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers may set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the websites. Disabling browser cookies may cause certain features of Wixware's websites to not function properly.</p>

          <p>Certain pages on the website may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. These sites set their own cookies and we do not have access or control over these cookies. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>

          <h2>Tracking technologies</h2>
          <p>We use third party tracking services, but we don’t use these services to track you individually or collect your personally identifiable-information. We use these services to collect information about how the website performs and how users navigate through and use the website so we can monitor and improve our content and website performance.</p>
          <p>Third party tracking services gather certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, timestamp, and similar data about your use of the website. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your username.</p>

          <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
          <p>"Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. Wixware does not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic tracking, which you may opt out of. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.</p>

          <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
          <p>If you already have an account on the websites, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by logging into your account and updating profile settings.</p>
          <p>Wixware will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Website, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our agreements.</p>
          <p>We will delete inactive accounts after a period of twelve (12) months. We will also erase information once it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed.</p>
          <p>Please note that due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personally-identifiable information indefinitely. For example, if you provide your information in connection with a blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.</p>

          <h2>Contacting Wixware about your Privacy</h2>
          <p>If you have questions or concerns about the way we are handling your information, or would like to exercise your privacy rights, please email us with the subject line "Privacy Concern" at Wixware Legal ( <a href='mailto:legal@wixware.com'>legal@wixware.com</a> ).</p>
