          <h2>Welcome to Wixware</h2>
          <p>Thanks for using our site to download software and apps. These Services are provided by Wixware with the collaboration of <a href='https://appzaib.com?ref_by=wixware&page=terms&lyv=true' target='_ublank'>Appzaib</a>.</p>
          <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms and Appzaib's terms. Please read them carefully <a href='https://appzaib.com/terms?ref_by=wixware&page=terms&lvy=true' target='_ublank'>here</a>.</p>
          <p>Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>
          
          <h2>Using our Services</h2>
          <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>
          <p>Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
          <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>
          <p>Our Services display some content that is not Appzaib’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>
          <p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>

          <h2>Your content in our Services</h2>
          <p>Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>
          <p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Wixware (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our Services, and to develop new ones.</p>

          <h2>About Software in our Services</h2>
          <p>When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>
          <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>
          <p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.</p>

          <h2>Termination</h2>
          <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether. We may terminate or suspend access to our Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation.</p>
          <p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. We may also stop providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>
          <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

          <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
          <p>There are few things that we don’t promise about our Services, other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Wixware nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific promises about the Services.</p>

          <h2>Liability of our Services</h2>
          <p>Wixware, and Wixware’s suppliers and distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. The total liability of Wixware, and its suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Services again).</p>

          <h2>About these Terms</h2>
          <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
